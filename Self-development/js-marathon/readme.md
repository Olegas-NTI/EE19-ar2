# [Marathon by Vladilen Minin](https://vladilen.ru/marathon) 

Marthon consisted of 5 different projects the we have built under 5 days. It includes funny challenges that improve your skills in javascript. By each completed project you could get points that you later had chance to invest in certain things the author of the marathon could offer.
We used [jsfiddle](https://jsfiddle.net) to hand in our projects that have been checked by author's staff in order to gain coins and gain access to the following day challenge.
