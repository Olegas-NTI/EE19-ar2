    <h1>Madison Beer - Dead</h1>

    <p>You could be here, but you're there
        You could be anywhere and these days I don't even care no more
        You only be showing me love whenever you've had too much
        Whatever's been filling your cup, no more</p>
    <p>
        Baby, no more showing up when you're not sober
        At my front door just to say you're alone tonight
        Yeah, tryna fuck me and my mind up
        It's a reminder you're a liar and you know I'm right
    </p>
    <p>
        You say you can't live without me
        So why aren't you dead yet?
        Why you still breathing? (why, why?)
        And if you say you can't live without me
        Then why aren't you dead yet?
        Why do you say that?
    </p>
    <p>
        You could be here but you're not, I give whatever you want
        But you just take it and run, you run (oh run, run)
        And I give you so many shots but you just drinking 'em all
        You never give it a thought, oh love (yeah)
        Baby, no more showing up when you're not sober (sober)
        At my front door just to say you're alone tonight (alone tonight)
        Yeah, tryna fuck me and my mind up
        It's a reminder you're a liar and you know I'm right
    </p>
    <p>
        You say you can't live without me
        So why aren't you dead yet?
        Why you still breathing? (why, why?)
        If you say you can't live without me
        Then why aren't you dead yet?
        Why do you say that?
    </p>
    <p>
        Why, why, why, why?
        Why, why, why, why?
        Why, why, why, why?
        Why aren't you dead yet?
    </p>
    <p>
        Be careful what you say
        Say only what you mean
        Mean to me then you're nice
        You're nice, you're nice
        It's nice to know you now
        Now that it all went down
        Down on your knees you cry
        You cry, you cry, yeah
        You say you can't live without me
        So why aren't you dead yet?
        Why you still breathing? (why, why?)
        And you say you can't live without me
        Then why aren't you dead yet?
        Why do you say that?
    </p>
    <p>
        Why, why, why, why?
        Why, why, why, why?
        Why, why, why, why?
        Why aren't you dead yet?
        Why, why, why, why?
        Why
        Why aren't you dead yet?
    </p>
