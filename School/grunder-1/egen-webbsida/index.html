    <h1>Lil Skies - Riot</h1>

    <p>CashMoneyAP
        Yeah (Yeah), yeah (Woah, woah, woah) <br>
        I (Woah, woah, woah, woah) <br>
        I (Yeah) <br>
        Ayy</p>

    <p>
        Walkin' dripped out, you see the details <br>
        I got water on me, drippin' like a seashell <br>
        I gave her lust, she wanted love, I told her, "Oh, well" <br>
        When I was broke, I busted traps straight off my Nextel <br>
        What you gon' do when you make it? <br>
        'Lot of people change when it comes to being famous <br>
        Fifty thousand cash in my pockets when I lane switch <br>
        I'm a rich nigga, I won't fuck her if she basic <br>
        She a rich bitch, cut a nigga off for fakin'</p>

    <p>
        Nightmare on Elm street, I kill Freddy like I'm Jason <br>
        Hardly ever sleep, I told the doctor I'm dream chasin' <br>
        I gave her the addy, she popped up and we got faded <br>
        Ten minutes later she was naked, ass shakin' <br>
        Real rockstar, them pretenders just be playin' <br>
        If I got a problem, then my brother get to sprayin' <br>
        Don't care what he say, we gon' catch him where he layin' <br>
        And I'ma boss up on any occasion <br>
        Young nigga poppin' tags <br>
        Young nigga got a bag and he got his own swag, let's go <br>
        Young nigga stay low, got a lot of pesos <br>
        And he sellin' out shows, you know <br>
        I'ma die for the gang, spent like eighty on my chain <br>
        Tryna snatch it, take your brain <br>
        Big smoke nigga, you ain't never help your mans <br>
        Hit a lick for twenty bands, that put ten up in his hands <br>
        You a ho, nigga, and I'm livin' by the code</p>

     <p>I got hoes down the road, when I'm bored sell my soul <br>
        Hear me on the radio, girl, I'm in my glow <br>
        I got money and the flow, it look like I'm sellin' dope <br>
        Why your baby-daddy broke? That nigga is a joke <br>
        I should probably put him on, but I probably really won't <br>
        Call Stan send a boat, the gang stay afloat <br>
        Got bread by the loaf, turn a pussy nigga toast <br>
        I'm too nice with this <br>
        She wanna come suck, I told her, "Come ride the dick" <br>
        My gang on full attack, this that real riot shit <br>
        You fuck around, get clapped, tryna high five and shit <br>
        I don't wanna talk about it, 'cause I just do it <br>
        You would rather tweet about it, nigga just stupid <br>
        I be with a bad bitch, break her heart, cupid <br>
        Done livin' average, the truth was in my music</p>
